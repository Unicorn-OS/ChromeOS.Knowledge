>There is another crbug feature request to allow accessing usb storage devices, this is still open and is being worked on, see below:
>- Issue 980456 - Allow passing external storage from USB or SD card slot fully to use with format/partitioning tools in Crostini. - chromium
>https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=980456
>The above feature, when implemented would address these two aspects:
>1. Try to fully access an external drive or SD Card.
>2. You can only share individual folders currently

>I suppose sharing the volume/folder with Linux will not expose enough access for your purposes.
